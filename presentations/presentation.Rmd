# Introduction

\notesonly
Hello everyone and welcome to the presentation of my thesis / paper / ... on **Presentation Title** which I devised under the joint supervision of Prof. XY and her peers at ETH ZÃ¼rich: Prof. XY, Dr. XY and XY.
\notesend

## Motivation

Let's showcase some animation:

\centertext
\overlay
![some graph](figures/graph.pdf){width=6cm}
\hidenotes
\overlaynext
![some graph](figures/graph_orange.pdf){width=6cm}
\overlaynext
![some graph](figures/graph_green.pdf){width=6cm}
\overlaynext
![some graph](figures/graph_blue.pdf){width=6cm}
\overlaynext
![some graph](figures/graph_red.pdf){width=6cm}
\overlayend
\hidenotesend
\notesonlyraw{. . . . .}
\overlay[6-]
![some graph](figures/graph_purple.pdf){width=6cm}
\overlayend
\centerend

Observe that every image is displayed at the same position and we obtain a smooth animation.

\notesonly

This is -- obviously -- only visible in the speaker notes. For technical reasons, it is advisible to make newlines before and after the '\\notesonly' statement

Color order (every click uncovers one color):

* orange,
* green,
* blue,
* red,
* purple.

\notesend

. . .

$\implies$ we may use math formulas inline. Also, note the three dots causing a 'pause' requiring a click to proceed / uncover the remainder of the slide.

# Main Stuff

## Some Definitions / Proofs

We can even use very involved / low-level \LaTeX commands by using

\notesonlyraw{\framebreak}

\hidenotes

## Some Slide Feature {.t}

Note the {.t} attribute for the slide title; however, I don't recall what it is meant for. Check out the pandoc markdown documentation!

\hidenotesend

## Conclusion

This should be enough to showcase how simple making LaTeX slides can be with this. I'll upload the rendered output of this example as well.
