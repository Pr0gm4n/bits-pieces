# little bits & pieces

- `sonos.py`: command line helper for easy, performant keyboard shortcuts to control my Sonos system
- `pull_subdirectories.sh`: used to run 'git pull' in all subdirectories containing a '.git' folder
- `RMarkdown.R`: used to render RMarkdown to latex presentations and speaker notes (see the `presentations` folder)
